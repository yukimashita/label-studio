## Label Studio Enterprise 2.18.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Link comments to fields, export information from the Annotator Performance dashboard </div>

*Nov 19, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.7.1

### New features

#### Link comments to fields

You can now link comments to specific regions or fields within an annotation.

This change will help improve clarity between Annotators and Reviewers, enhancing the quality review process.

For more information, see [Comments and notifications](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/comments_notifications).

#### Export information from the Annotator Performance dashboard

There is a new **Export** action available from the [Annotator Performance dashboard.](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_annotator)

- **Report** - Download the information in the dashboard as CSV or JSON.
- **Timeline** - Download a detailed timeline of all the user's annotation actions within the timeframe, including when the began and submitted each annotation.
- **Comments Received** - Download a CSV file with all of the comments that other users have left on the user's annotations.

### Enhancements

#### Performance score added to the Annotator Performance dashboard

A **Performance Score** metric has been added to the Annotator Performance dashboard metrics. This reflects the overall performance of annotators in terms of review actions (**Accept**, **Reject**, **Fix+Accept**). For more information, see [Performance summaries](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_annotator#Performance-summaries).

#### Edit regions when classifying video frames

We recently introduced the ability to perform [video frame classification](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/video_frame_classification) with the `<TimelineLabels>` tag.

You now have the ability to edit the frame spans you select in the timeline editor, making it easier to control which frames you want to label.

#### Improved usability on project settings pages

There are a number of [project settings](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse) that are only applicable when auto distribution is enabled for users.

To prevent confusion, settings that are not applicable will be hidden when manual distribution is enabled.

This means the following settings will be hidden when **Annotation > Distribute Labeling Tasks** is set to **Manual**:

- **Annotation > Task Sampling**
- **Quality > Overlap of Annotations**
- **Quality > Low Agreement Strategy**

#### Hotkey to show/hide all regions

A new hotkey (**Ctrl + h**) has been added. Use this shortcut to hide all regions. Or, if no regions are visible, show all regions.
